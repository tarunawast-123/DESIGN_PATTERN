Creational Design Pattern:

1) Prototype design pattern : 
   It is used when we have to make copy from existing object.
 
2) Builder design pattern :
  
   1) create student class
   2) create abstract student builder
   create constructor in student class based on student builder object
   3) create director class to call student builder or its instance create builder class
   4) call director class which in turn student builder which is having build method
  

3) factory design pattern
4) abstract factory: factory of factory
5) Singleton design pattern: double check locking
